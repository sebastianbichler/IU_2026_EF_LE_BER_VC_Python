### DLBDSIPWP01 - Einführung in die Programmierung mit Python (Projekt)

---

## End of March 2026

- turn in all project parts into PeddlePad (possible from beginning of March, but deadline is end of March)

## #12 2026-02-24, Tuesday (3 UE)

- room: Einstein
- students present their current work with focus on
    - on scientific aspect
    - modeling and capsuling of the problem
        - use of OOP, design patterns, etc.
        - use of core functionality in different views (GUI, Notebooks, etc., test cases)
    - draft of implementation
    - test cases (methods to evaluate the implementation)
    - documentation within code should be in English
    - clean your code according to the PEP8 style guide (use ruff for linting and formatting)
- group project work time (break out sessions)
- consulting for student projects

## #11 2026-02-23, Monday (3 UE)

- room: Turing
- present document structure for final report (pdf)
- OOP
    - DSBINFOPEPP01_WiSe25-26_Python_Lektion5.pdf
    - Schrödinger programmiert Python
    - docs/OOP_P1.md...OOP_P4.md
- GUI (tkinter from Schrödinger programmiert Python)
- Design Patten in Python (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-design-patterns/)
- group project work time (break out sessions)
- code review session

## #10 2026-02-10, Tuesday (3 UE)

- DSBINFOPEPP01_WiSe25-26_Python_Lektion4.pdf (see Teams-Group)
    - Moduls and packages
    - Dörn: Appendix A: Important modules with its description
- group project work time (break out sessions)

## #9 2026-02-09, Monday (3 UE) (CURRENT LECTURE)

- Do not use anaconda for c++ extensions, use venv and pip instead
- DSBINFOPEPP01_WiSe25-26_Python_Lektion3.pdf (see Teams-Group)
    - Funktionen
    - Fehler und Ausnahmen
- HINT: Use most important design principle as capsuling in order to use variant implementations of the same
  functionality (e.g. different algorithms for the same task) and to be able to easily switch between them (GUI,
  Console, etc.)
- 3-5 papers for concepts and finale report (see it like a paper)
- group project work time (break out sessions)
    - Goal: get a first specification/design for the prototype of the project idea

## #8 2026-02-03, Tuesday (3 UE)

- group project work time
- concept review and feedback
    - G07: use tabs instead of spaces for indentation in order to avoid formatting issues

## #7 2026-02-02, Monday (3 UE)

- Leonie Kinsky, Oliver Mayer placed in group 10
- each group/each reads a scientifc paper and summarizes it and reflects how this can be used for the tas
    - name the paper
- group project work time
- How to turn-in instructions via PebblePad (pdf)
    - only final report is required to be turned in
    - however, test it today

## #6 2026-01-27, Tuesday (3 UE)

- Presentation (P2) of project concepts by student groups (if there is time) or work in breakout-rooms
    - G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9

## #5 2026-01-26, Monday (3 UE)

- Check local linter and formatter setup
    - use ruff for both linting and formatting
    - delete black if installed in order to avoid conflicts
- Group presentations: 1, 2
